","Dear,

We've acknowledged your request to close your account associated with mail@marc-richter.info. As per your request, all redis databases will be deleted, which denotes all data would be permanently removed. To clarify further, your account has been downgraded, thus concluding your existing subscription. 

Please note that as a token of our appreciation to your loyalty and valuable feedback, a 10% discount was designed for your next subscription duration which would have reduced your premium costs by 880$. Despite this, post your request, we've had to quash this potential benefit.

On top of this, we've also previously upgraded your account to premium as per one of your prior requests. Appreciating that changes in circumstances can call for different requirements, we ensure to remain responsive to your needs. 

Please bear in mind that sometimes not all account changes are manageable online and hence the necessity to reach out to us. 

Thank you for your understanding. 

Best regards,"
