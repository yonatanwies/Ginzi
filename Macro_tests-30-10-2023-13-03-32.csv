Hi {{ticket.requester.first_name}},

The err=6 error is a relatively common encryption error, meaning that somewhere in the encryption process that generates the hash key at the end of the query string for the iframe, something went wrong, and the hash key is incorrect. What we do in cases of this error is ask for the outputs for each step of the hash key building process to debug.

Below I have an example of how the query string is built, and what we'll need is example values of each step of the process, when it's UTF8 encoded, HMACS encoded, etc

One common cause of this error in sandbox is using the production encryption key, instead of the sandbox key, so that's a possible thing to check, as well.

Kind regards,

Thanks,
