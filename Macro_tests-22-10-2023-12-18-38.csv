","Dear Sir/Madam, 

As a token of our appreciation for your loyalty and the valuable feedback that you have shared with us, we have decided to grant you a 10% discount for the next year. This will reduce your premium costs by 880$. 

Moreover, following your recent request, we've downgraded your account. You mentioned that you faced an issue trying to remove your expired credit card. Also, you mentioned that the last payment was declined, likely due to charges applied to the expired card and not the most recent. Unfortunately, you're unsure about how to set the new card as the default. 

I understand how frustrating this may be and assure you that we're committed to providing a resolution promptly. 

Best regards"
