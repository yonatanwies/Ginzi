Hi {{ticket.requester.first_name}} ,  Payee {{ticket.ticket_field_27964921}} (Cc'd here) reached out to us to unlock their account.  Accounts become locked after 5 failed login attempts and remain locked for 10 hours after the most recent failed login attempt. If the account is still locked, you can look up the payee details in your PayPer dashboard, click the Actions button, hover over Payee Status and Unlock payee account. If that option is not there, the account is no longer locked. A good idea would also be to send a password reset email.    I hope this helps.  Kind regards,
