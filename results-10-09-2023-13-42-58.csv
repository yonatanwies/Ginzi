Buff,85533,"Hey your apps been buffering and slow and not accepting xp more often than before. The windows are fine, I've been using this app for a while now, and I even bought the buff pass.

","Dear customer,

Thank you for reaching out to us with your request. I understand that you would like to add a second listings page to your website, specifically for pet-friendly listings. 

To assist you better, could you please provide me with some additional information? 

1. Could you please confirm if your website is hosted on the Guesty platform?
2. Are you looking to create a separate page exclusively for pet-friendly listings or add a filter option on the existing listings page to display only pet-friendly listings?
3. Do you already have a list of the pet-friendly properties that you would like to include on the new listings page?
4. Would you like the pet-friendly listings page to have a different design or layout than the homepage with all listings?
5. Is there any specific functionality or feature you would like to have on the pet-friendly listings page?

Once I have these details, I will be able to provide you with the appropriate steps to achieve your goal. Thank you for your cooperation.

Best regards,
