Payee {{ticket.ticket_field_27964921}} ​​ (Cc'd here) reached out to us to unlock their account.

Accounts become locked after 5 failed login attempts and remain locked for 10 hours after the most recent failed login attempt. If the account is still locked, you can look up the payee details in your PayPer dashboard, click the Actions button, hover over Payee Status and Unlock payee account. If that option is not there, the account is no longer locked. A good idea would also be to send a password reset email.

I hope this helps.

Encryption error,11742687110161,"Hi {{ticket.requester.first_name}},

The err=6 error is a relatively common encryption error, meaning that somewhere in the encryption process that generates the hash key at the end of the query string for the iframe, something went wrong, and the hash key is incorrect. What we do in cases of this error is ask for the outputs for each step of the hash key building process to debug.

Below I have an example of how the query string is built, and what we'll need is example values of each step of the process, when it's UTF8 encoded, HMACS encoded, etc

One common cause of this error in sandbox is using the production encryption key, instead of the sandbox key, so that's a possible thing to check, as well.
